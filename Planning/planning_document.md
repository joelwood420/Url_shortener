## 1. Project Name

What will you call your project?

**Project Name:** url shortner




## 2. Problem Statement

What problem does your project solve? Why is this problem important?


Many people struggle to manage and share long URLs, which can be cumbersome and unattractive. Long URLs can be difficult to remember, share, and fit into character-limited platforms like social media. This problem is important because it affects user experience, link sharing efficiency, and can even impact click-through rates for marketing campaigns. A URL shortener simplifies this process by converting long URLs into shorter, more manageable links that are easier to share and remember.









## 3. Project Description

Briefly describe your project. What is it about? What does it do? How will it work?

My project is a URL shortener web application that allows users to easily convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. Users will input the long URL they want to shorten, and the app will generate a unique short URL that redirects to the original link. The app will also provide users with analytics on link clicks, allowing them to track the performance of their shared links. The backend will use a database to store the original URLs and their corresponding short URLs, ensuring that the redirection works seamlessly. This project aims to improve the user experience of sharing links online by making them more concise and easier to handle.

- Name and basic demographics (age, occupation, etc.)
